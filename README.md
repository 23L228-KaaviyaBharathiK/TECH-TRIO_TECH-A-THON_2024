Project Overview
TECH-TRIO_TECH-A-THON_2024 is a conversational AI chatbot project developed for the Tech-A-Thon 2024 competition. Our team, TECH-TRIO, aims to create a chatbot that provides emotional support and resources for users dealing with mental health issues.

Features
- Conversational AI interface
- Emotional understanding and response generation
- Resource provision for mental health support

Technologies Used
- TensorFlow
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK library
  
Training Data
The chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents and responses stored in intents.json. The data includes patterns, tags, and responses for various mental health topics.

Model Architecture
The chatbot uses a sequential model with two dense layers and two dropout layers, built using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.

Functions

- bag_of_words: converts user input into a bag-of-words representation
- chat: main chat function that takes user input and responds accordingly

Acknowledgments
